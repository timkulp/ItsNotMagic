# Chapter 1: Someone Has Come Along

After leaving the village the players embark into the wilderness following the map or the barbarians. If the players are following the Barbarians, they will need to make stealth checks along the way to ensure that they go undetected. It is up to you as the game master how often these checks are needed. Using the rules for Random Encounters should give you a decent cadence and keep the players on their toes.

## Sneaking along and hiding

Throughout the moutain range there are networks of caverns that are both vast and deep. Some of these caverns lead to dark depths so best not to go wandering. If the players are following the Barbarians, the caverns can be good places to hide to avoid detection, but caverns can have creatures lurking in them. Any time the players duck into a cavern check for a random encounter. Use random encounter charts for Moutain Encounters to determine what the players find.

## Lost on the Road

As the characters are making their way along the road (sneaking or with the Barbarians) they see a wandering stranger.

`A female dwarf is stumbling up the path towards you. As she approaches, you see her leather shirt stained with blood and glowing blue smears. Her eyes are glazed over, her red hair is wild and patchy as if she has been pulling it out. She doesn’t notice you as she walks through you mumbling something about the eyes, the traps, the wizard.`

The female dwarf is Untala. She was one of the adventurers to go in to the dungeon with The Returned from the tavern. She was left behind after the others thought her to be dead. Engaging with Untala doesn’t provide much information. She is in shock and falling deeper into madness from her experiences in the dungeon. If the players start talking to her, she will mumble the following. Keep repeating these phrases as all she can think about now are these things:

`Monsters in the darkness. Flood of darkness. Everywhere darkness.`

`He didn’t help. They just left me there. They left me for the eyes.`

`The Wizard…what did he do? Why? Why did he leave it in the body? The Scarab.`

`The door behind the bookcase.`

`Did you see the eyes? They’re right there.`

Untala keeps walking and doesn’t stop. Eventually she walks off from the party, never really noticing them to begin with, and wanders into the mountain wilderness. Untala is another warning to the players that this dungeon is no place for the weary.

## Meeting Cashus (totally optional help for your players)

If none of your players are Rogues and you want to throw them a bone, you can have the players encounter Cashus on the road. Cashus is a male halfling level 4 Rogue who is also heading to the dungeon. He can be a helpful NPC for the players or just some color to the game. If you have rogue players in the adventure already you might want to skip including Cashus.

If the players are using stealth to follow the Barbarians, then so is Cashus. You could have the players notice Cashus along the path or he notice them both stalking the barbarians in the shadows. Cashus is a friendly fellow looking for cooperative team members like the players to help him raid this dungeon’s many treasures.

While playing Cashus, treat him as the happy go lucky type who is very focused on getting the treasure. His main motivation is around starting over from his old life in a neighboring village where his run ins with the law have forced him to start fresh in another town. Cashus sees the dungeon’s treasure as a means to start over back home. He’s excited for going back home, paying off his debts to the authorities and owning a tavern that welcomes adventurers with tales of faraway lands. Cashus’ biggest flaw is that he’s hung up on the mistakes of his past. Due to this, he often jumps to try and prove himself but he is a coward. He’s not going to put himself in danger to help others but will do everything he can if it is safe.

If you want to make Cashus a memorable character, show him conquer his own fear and self doubt to help the players. While he is often paralyzed by fear, have him go out on a limb for the players to save the day as you progress through the adventure.

## Entrance to the Madhouse

`You arrive to an entry way carved into the mountain side. The once majestic reliefs and sculptures of angelic figures now festering with black fungus as if dead mushrooms sprung directly from the rock. At the center of the entrance was a door fit for a Mountain Giant both in it’s size and grandeur. Dark oak wood with gun metal iron framing smelled of decay like the wood was rotting from inside the dungeon. A large golden handle invites you to the riches inside.`

Eventually the players reach the entrance to the Madhouse (the Wizard’s Dungeon). There are few critical things questions that need to be answered now:

1. If the players were following the Barbarians, do they wait for the Barbarians to enter or do they reveal themselves and attempt to join up with the Barbarians?
2. If you have any players using The Awakened adventure hook, how does seeing the dungeon doors impact them (if at all). The Psionic powers of the Beast cannot penetrate the dungeon door but characters with awakened psionic powers would be able to feel that they are close to the wellspring of these powers.
3. Any magic user in the party would instantly feel their connection with magic strained at the door.

### Barbarians

When the players left the tavern they could have done the following: joined the Barbarians at which point they are all together at this point or followed the Barbarians to the dungeon entrance. If the players joined the Barbarians out right then there is nothing to settle here. Everyone just goes in.

If the players have been following the Barbarians to this point then now is the time to either reveal themselves or sneak into the dungeon behind the Barbarians. If the players let the Barbarians proceed into the dungeon without them then we’ll see the Barbarians later in the adventure.

If the players reveal they have been following the barbarians the whole time and ask to join with them – well things don’t go as well. The Barbarians will feel like the players are being sneaky and looking to rob them of the treasures inside. This leads to the Barbarians being aggressive and suspicious. Players can try to use their Charisma and sweet talking techniques to convince the Barbarians to let them join. If these attempts fail, then a scuffle will break out. Keep the scuffle short with the goal of both parties to being: get into the dungeon without the others following.

### Awakening

If you have players using *The Awakening* adventure hook, they should have the following vision as they open the door.

`The door bursts open as a flood of black, oily liquid floods out towards you. Crashing waves of the oil rushes towards you as a faint howling can be heard from the darkness pouring forth from the doorway. Putting up your hands to brake the massive wave of darkness, you shield your eyes and then nothing. Looking again to the door you see only an open door but you feel an overwhelming sense of dread of what lies inside.`

This is the darkness that has brought the psionic powers to this world. The howling is that of the countless horrors inside awaiting to devour the minds of the characters.

### Magic

Within the dungeon players will find that magic is hard to control or summon. The magical fabric of the multiverse is weak here leading to duration, range and saving throws all being impacted.

**Duration** for all spells is cut in half as magic is being weakened. All magical energies once manifest are pulled apart more quickly in the dungeon.

**Range** for all spells is half of normal as the magical energies dissolve faster here.

**Saving Throws** all creatures in the dungeon get a +3 to all saving throws making magical effects more difficult to apply to another creature.

As the players go deeper into the dungeon, the reason for these effects become more apparent.
