# Epilogue

Calvin is dead, the portal is closed but some things cannot be undone. While the characters lose their psionic powers immediately as the portal closes the real consequences of Calvin’s actions are yet to be realized. The Other that Calvin was communicating with now knows of this world and the insatiable hunger that exists among wizards to grow their power to other worlds. While Calvin has been stopped, the invasion is just beginning as The Other reaches out again…

`A tower scrapes the clouds many lands away from Calvin’s dungeon. In the top most room, a room of all glass glows an amazing sunset. The bright colors of dusk cast the room in a golden glow. In the center of the room a wizard works diligently on his latest experiment. “Its finally ready.” The old wizard steps back from his table. “I must get provisions for the journey ahead.” He gathers his satchel and two large sacks to get food and supplies for his journey from the village. As he walks out the door, the golden glow of sunset illuminates the room save for the black stone on his table. The black orb, an Obsidian Orb, devours the the sun’s light casting no shadow. Across the room a crack forms in the wall and slowly, a viscous black fluid starts to drip to the floor.`
