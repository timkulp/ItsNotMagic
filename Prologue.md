# Prologue

*Its Not Magic* begins with the Players gathering in a tavern. Before the story starts, determine if the players know each other or have randomly sat together at a table. If you are using the Wandering In adventure hook you’ll jump to Enter the Madhouse. Time in the tavern is time for the players to figure out the lore and relationship they will have as a party.

## Prologue as a game mechanic

Prologue introduces the players to the game. As a game mechanic you can have the players hold off on building characters until **AFTER** the prologue. This way they can craft characters specific to the adventure.

You can use this game mechanic to enable your players to create characters specific for this adventure (warriors and rogues). If your players already have characters you can skip this mechanic. I've borrowed this idea from Wyrd's excellent **Tales from the Breach** game.

## Wild Night Tonight

`It is a wild one tonight! Adventuring parties are celebrating returns and departures in search of the fabled Wizard’s Dungeon. Some tables are celebrating their new found wealth returning from the dungeon. They sing songs of victory and tell tales of the many traps that fell others in their party.`

`Another table celebrates wildly as a party of barbarians drink and boast of the map they took from an uworthy party earlier that day. Standing on the table one of the barbarians raises his mug to toast his companions. The drink spills out of his mug and drips from his frizzy red beard. His companions sing drinking songs as each one takes turns waving around the map like prize game.`

There are a lot of NPCs in the tavern. Use them to bring color to your world. NPCs here are broken into three groups: those going to the dungeon, those coming back and the background characters. Here are some important characters you can use to flesh out the tavern.

## In the Tavern

**Gabby the Silent** is a bar maid who is serving the players their drinks/meal. She is tough, rugged and doesn’t take any guff from the tavern goers. Gabby has dark skin and an accent showing her heritage from the southern lands. She’s all business but will talk to the players while doing her tasks at their table/bar spot. Locals call Gabby, Gabby the Silent because of her constant focus on work and penchant to avoid small talk. She is direct and to the point which makes people think she’s not too friendly.

Gabby knows a lot about what happens in the tavern and can fill in some information around the adventure. Here are some sample things she knows and is willing to talk about:

“Why are those people celebrating?” 
`Those people, she signals to the returning party, just came back from the Wizard’s Dungeon. They found some gold, some jewels and now are acting like their rich. Give’em a day or two and all them will be like the rest. Drooling into their pillow, screaming about the eyes.`

”What do you mean like the rest?” 
`They aren’t the first to come back. Lately everyone who comes back goes crazy within a few days. No one ever spends the money they find. Locals say its cursed and return it to the mountain caverns to keep the curse far away from here.`

“Who are those people getting ready to leave?” 
`Those drunk barbarians stole a map to the Wizard’s Dungeon. Most who go don’t tell others how to get there. They want to keep the secret for themselves. Unfortunately they go crazy in a day or so. No one draws a map because no one can remember how to get there after they return. That might be the only map made.`

“Can you tell me about the dungeon?” 
`An old wizard use to live in a dungeon buried deep in the mountains. There’s a network of caverns that lead deep into the mountains and supposedly this wizard built a dungeon into those caverns to study dark magics. No one’s heard from him for months. Last time I saw him, he was getting supplies for a long journey.`

“Where is the dungeon?” 
`I don’t leave the village. Too dangerous out there and my adventuring days are behind me. Those barbarians have a map that is supposed to lead to the Wizard’s Dungeon.`

“Why are people going crazy?” 
`No one knows. A day or so after people return from the dungeon or caverns, they start raving about green eyes in the darkness.` 

### The Returned

The Returned celebrate at one table singing songs and lamenting over lost companions. Frequent solemn toasts are broken with cheers to the honored dead. At this table three adventures sit and are open to telling anyone who comes up about their conquest of the dungeon’s dangers.

If you’re using The Awakening adventure hook, any characters having the dreams will feel a sense of dread surrounding the Returned characters. The awakened characters will feel the presence of the psionic forces that infected the Returned while they were in the dungeon. 

**Calvin (3rd level Ranger – Neutral Good)** the obvious leader of the returned party, Calvin is jovial and celebratory as he raises mugs and cheers his friends. Dressed in simple, forest camouflage clothes, looks rugged and ready for the wilderness. 

**Liliput (2nd level Rogue – Neutral Good)** is a female elf spinning daggers on her finger tips with grace and ease. She’s enjoying her drinks while spinning and juggling her daggers between her fingers with a deft precision that is almost mesmerizing. Her leather armor is beaten and bloodied from what appears to be intense battles.

**Muntuk (3rd level Barbarian – Chaotic Good)** is a male orc pouring brew down his gullet as fast as Gabby can fill it. His gray skin is covered with tribal tattoos from his home far north. He wears pale furs that are splotched with blood stains and other gore from recent battles. It looks like Liliput and Muntuk were really in the thick of things recently. Muntuk is more somber than the others. He knows something is wrong – feeling that something followed them back as if being hunted. 

As a group the Returned are in good spirits (except Muntuk) and celebrating their victory. They make light of the weak minded who came before them claiming that those adventurers didn’t have the stomach for what they saw. When asked for details the returned just state: We went in with seven and came out as three. It’s no place for the weak of body or mind.

Here are some things the Returned will talk about:

“Where is the dungeon?” Calvin answers: 
`Ha! Yeah like we’re going to tell anyone where that treasure trove is.` 

“What happened out there?” Liliput answers: 
`Traps, traps and more traps. That place was built to keep people out. A thief’s kit and some skilled fingers are your best weapons down there. We didn’t go too deep because we found all the treasure we needed to mount another, more equipped excavation soon.`

“What about the rumors of the crazy?” Calvin answers: 
`Weak minds who can’t take the realities of death, dismemberment and general horrors of a twisted wizard’s keep. We’re not them. Muntuk answers: I’ve heard them screaming at night about the eyes. We didn’t see no eyes down there. I’ve been hunted before and I know the feeling. We didn’t see any eyes but I’m damn sure they saw us. Muntuk’s comments are sobering to the Returned as they all grow somber, quickly Calvin breaks the mood with a cheer to the fallen.`

### The Barbarians

On the other end of the tavern is a party of barbarians drinking and celebrating. They boast how earlier in the day they took a map from a wanderer in the mountains. The barbarians returned to the village to equip themselves for the journey into the Wizard’s Dungeon. They brag about leaving the wanderer wounded saying things like *He’ll be good feed for the wolves and Next time he’ll just give us what we want…well he’ll probably be dead by then* as the others burst into laughter. Everything about them is gross from their hygiene to their demeanor.

The barbarians are four 3rd level Barbarians all Chaotic Neutral. They’ve bound together to find the treasure but are likely to stab one another in the back as soon as a gold coin is spotted. While the barbarians are putting up a front as tough guys they are not trying to get into a fight tonight as they are looking to make it rich in the dungeon. They can’t go to the dungeon if they’re in the village jail tomorrow. So, as the players get confrontational the barbarians will just leave.

These barbarians have been celebrating for a long time tonight and are starting to lose their ability to notice things like someone stealing the map from them or the map falling to the floor. Try to encourage the players to steal the map but don’t force it. The theme of this adventure is seeking forbidden things by any means necessary. Stealing the map is a great example of crossing the moral boundaries to find what you’re looking for. If the players don’t steal the map, then have the barbarians drop the map as they leave the tavern. If the players return the map to the barbarians, the barbarians will extend an invitation for the players to join them as they go out to the dungeon. The barbarians will say *We need fodder for the creatures*. In this scenario the barbarians will be NPCs that will be trap fodder for the players.

Here are some responses if the players engage the barbarians:

“Can we see the map?” 
`What? I’m sorry did you ask if you could see the maps? No, of course you can’t.`

“What happened to the wanderer?” 
`We took what he didn’t want to give. Too bad for him that there were four of us and one of him. We left enough for the wolves.`

“They just got back over there, do you think you can do better?” 
`Those losers, if they can do it…I bet they didn’t really, we’re going to be rich beyond our dreams. We’re the Wildmen of the West, no beast nor danger can survive us and with these maps we’ll be unstoppable.`

“Maps?” `Two maps. One how to get there. The other is how to get to the treasures. Those idiots over there only saw a little bit of what is possible.`

## The Maps

Once the players have the map to the dungeon they are ready to move onto Chapter 1. If the players don’t obtain the map, they can follow the barbarians but must maintain stealth for the duration of Chapter 1 (which won’t be easy). 

The second map is of the interior of the dungeon. Provide the players with this map but the map is incorrect. This map was drawn to lead invaders to their death. Hidden on the map is another map that provides the true nature of the dungeon. The real map can be exposed with Illusory Script or by using True Sight. If the players decode the map, give them the new correct map for their reference.

## Prologue Conclusion

`You strike out to find the dungeon and as you leave, catch the eye of Muntuk the Orc you met earlier. He is looking at you as if looking at a dead person. His eyes quickly jolt over to an empty corner of the room where he sees something that horrifies him causing a violent reaction as he falls from his stool to the ground. Stunned, he blinks hard and shakes his head. Looking back to the spot that startled him you see nothing. Muntuk again looks towards you as the shock in his eyes fades to resolute despair…he knows now those who came before him were not weak minded. They were just like him and soon he will be just like them.`
