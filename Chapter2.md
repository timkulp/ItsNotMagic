# Chapter 2: Enter the Madhouse

Chapter two starts as the players enter the madhouse, aka the Wizard’s Dungeon. At this point the players are in reach of the psionic powers from the Beast as soon as they step into the dungeon. 

`As soon as you cross the threshold of the dungeon you feel a rush, like a powerful wind, blow over you. As it subsides you feel drained as if all the energy got sucked out of you.`

The rush of energy is the Beast’s psionic powers starting to effect them. Each player should take an Intelligence check against a Hard DC to see if the exhaustion effects the character. Any character involved in The Awakened adventure hook get a +2 bonus to their check as their psionic powers would naturally resist the psionic assault of another.

## Why is it called the Madhouse?

This dungeon is being infected by other worldly powers leaking into it from a portal to the unknown. As a result, this place is a nightmare come to life. Psionic powers from the Beast as well as from the other world are constantly assaulting the players. Calling this place “The Madhouse” is fitting as the psionic projections could induce a state of madness. 

The characters are strong, so while it doesn’t cause madness they can have numerous mass hallucinations. Treat a hallucination like a random encounter and check every once in a while. How often is up to you but make sure it is a shared experience.

Hallucinations can be broken with an Intelligence check against Fear. Use your judgement on how difficult to make the check based on your players. Any Awakened (Psionic) character should have +2 to the check signaling their ability to resist psionic attack. If a character breaks the hallucination, they no longer experience the hallucination and can help others break the hallucination on the next round. A character who has broken the hallucination provides a +1 to the Intelligence check against Fear for the character they are helping.

### Hallucinations

#### Monster from the Darkness

`Your torchlight casts long shadows around you. You hear something lurking in those shadows as a monstrosity steps out and launches into an attack.`

**Duration** Combat

**Effect** This is the same as a random encounter

**Description** This hallucination is creating a monster from nothing. Use the Monstrous Manual’s (or Xanthar’s Guide to Everything) Random Encounter tables to select a monster to attack the characters. Feel free to generate multiple monsters to battle the players. 

These monsters are not real and cannot kill the characters. Any character reduced to zero hit points falls but is not killed (because these monsters aren’t real). If all characters are reduced to zero hit points then read the following:

`As you collapse to the ground you see the monstrosities evaporate as if made of smoke. Closing your eyes you find yourself standing again with the rest of your party battle ready. In but a blink, you seem to have all returned to just before the monsters appeared.`

If the characters defeat the monsters:
`As the last monstrosity collapses you see it fade away as if a plume of smoke. All signs of the battle have vanished as you find yourself and the rest of your party battle ready, just as you were prior to the monsters’ appearance.`

#### Approaching Noise

`Rushing in your direction you can hear the heavy clopping of a hooved monstrosity. The hoof steps get faster as they close in on your location. You cannot see anything approaching but based on what you hear, a vicious creature approaches.`

**Duration** 2 rounds

**Effect** None

**Description** This hallucination is about building fear and anticipation. Have the players take their actions for a combat round. If they ask if they can see it, tell them that they cannot see into the darkness from which the sound is emanating. On the second round read the following:

`The pounding hooves is shaking dust from the dungeon around you as the beast approaches. A whaling howl begins to deafen you from the darkness.` 

Characters need to make a check against deafening attack or be left incapacitated as they crumble to the ground grasping their ears. 

At the end of Round 2 read the following:

`The whaling and hooves silence. The darkness from which they were came has receded back from your torch light and you see no signs of a beast, or the dust that was raining from the ceiling moments ago.`

#### Engulfed in Darkness

`Sound muffles around you as a thick liquid darkness pours in around you. Before you can react the liquid is up to your knees and flowing from all around you.`

**Duration** 3 rounds

**Effect** During the 3rd round, treat the effect the same as drowning

**Description** This hallucination has the effect of the area filling up with darkness as if the darkness was a liquid. Round 1 the liquid is up to their knees no matter the size of the room. Round 2 the liquid is up to the torso and Round 3 it has engulfed their heads. The size of the character does not matter because this is only a hallucination and is how the characters perceive things are happening. After the third round the hallucination will stop leaving the players exactly where they were when the hallucination started. 

#### Voice of the Damned

`From behind you a voice is talking quietly: “But I’m damn sure they saw us.” You recognize the voice as Muntuk from the tavern but as you look for him, he is no where to be seen.`

**Duration** Immediate

**Effect** None

**Description** Feel free to change what was said or who said it but this hallucination is a throw back to the tavern where the players and characters are reminded that they are not the first ones to come here. Use comments from the Returned (see Prologue > In the Tavern > The Returned) for content or use this to link back to a character's back story. Perhaps they have wronged someone in their past or someone they couldn't save. 

#### Eyes of the Beast

Just out of your torch light you see two glowing green eyes with thin black slits down the center watching you. While you cannot see any facial features or tell any attributes of the creature other than the glowing green eyes, you feel as if it is smiling at you. Not a friendly smile, the smile of a predator watching helpless prey. Waving your torch to illuminate the creature makes the eyes vanish but the feeling of being watch lingers moments later.

**Duration** Immediate

**Effect** +1 to all Hallucination checks for the party going forward. If the characters have another Eyes of the Beast roll, they will see the eyes again but will not add to their hallucination checks in the future. 

**Description** This hallucination is catching the attention of the Beast. The Beast will see the characters at this point which makes them (the characters) more susceptible to its psionic attacks. Astute players will recognize these to be the eyes that they were warned of in the tavern.

### The Awakened Awake

In this chapter the players with The Awakening adventure hook gain control of their psionic and become dual class Mystics. Players get to select one Talent and 1 Discipline. The dual class rules apply throughout the rest of the adventure. Be careful to keep the game moving and don’t let the players linger of the rules of Psionics too long. You might even want to assign their talent and discipline to keep the game moving along.

One way to keep this change for the players simple is to provide them with index cards describing their Talent and Discipline. An example of the cards can be found at [Psionic Cards](PsionicCards).

## The Madhouse

![Map of the Madhouse](images/madhousemap.jpg)

### 1. The Entryway

The entry way is an open gathering place. The entrance looks nice and welcoming. The players will find some gems strewn around the door as soon as they walk in for a value of 8 gems. 

`The entrance is a wide-open place. The stone brick walls are smooth and polished. Hanging on the wall you find a map of the dungeon with the rooms and features noted. On the floor by the door you see a cluster of gems strewn around the floor and what appears to be a hammer with a head made of diamond. Apparently, the last treasure hunters dropped something while they were heading out the door. There must be so much treasure in here that you can't hold it all.`

**Hammer of Shattering** is critical to destroy the power source allowing psionic energy flowing from the other dimension. The players will need this hammer later in the game. If they examine the hammer read the following:

`A master piece of craftsmanship the hammer appears to be the work of a Wizard. No forge could have cast such a perfectly formed hammer. The head is made of a gem that is not diamond but looks strikingly similar – closer examination shows it is some form of ultra-hard glass. The handle is wood wrapped with leather with an obsidian orb at the base. Clearly this is a tool, not a weapon as it looks like a hammer one would use to nail or break something.` 

**Map** This map shows the layout of the dungeon but is not correct. It is the attached to the wall and is not removable. If the players take note, give them the sample map from Appendix C and encourage them to update as they wish.

### 2. The Main Hall

The main hall is a long hallway laden with traps. The walls are shiny enough to carry the torch light all the way down the hall.
 
`As you step into the long hallway you instantly feel a flood of exhaustion. The feeling passes quickly. You see in front of you a long narrow hallway with glossy walls that carry your torch light all the way down the hall to where a wooden door awaits. Along the walls you notice strange scrapes and scratches along the floor. In a few spots you notice blood stains on the walls and floor. You see some coins glittering in the torch light throughout the hallway. A buzzing sound echoes throughout the hallway making it impossible to pinpoint an origin.`
 
As players proceed down the hall there are two traps to avoid. These traps are very real and were originally constructed by the wizard who lived here to keep people out.

#### Traps

The traps are marked on the fake map which by now the characters will realize is not accurate to the layout of the dungeon. 

##### T1: Poison Darts

**Simple Trap:** Level 1-4, moderate threat

**Purpose:** Slay

The poison darts are to test the physical strength of the invader. Poison needles are just poison enough to test the strength of the players.

**Trigger:** Floor plate
The floor plate can be detected with a Wisdom check (perception) DC 20.

**Effects**
DC 10 (Moderate)
Damage 1d10
Poison duration 1d4 rounds

**Disabling**
To disable the trap, players need to do two checks. One check is to understand the triggering mechanism, the next being using nimble fingers to disarm.

1. Intelligence Check DC10 to figure out how it works.
2. Dexterity Check DC10 (with thieves kit) or DC15 (without kit)

##### T2: Saw Blades

**Simple Trap:** Level 5-10, dangerous threat

**Purpose:** Slay

The saw blades are again to challenge the physical capabilities of the players. The saw blades are trying to cut the players down and catch them from below as well.

**Trigger:** Unbroken light beam

From a small hole in the wall is a beam of light that projects across the hallway. The light beam can be noticed with a Wisdom (perception) check of DC10. If that is successful, players need to make another perception check DC15 to detect a receiver on the opposite wall. If that succeeds then an intelligence check DC10 will tell the players that they need to BREAK the beam of light to disarm the trap.

Breaking the light beam makes an audible click that stops the ambient buzzing sound.

**Effects**
DC 20 (Deadly)
Damage 10d10 (55)

**Disabling**
To disable the trap players need to use the Thieves Kit at DC15, no kit takes DC20. An attempt to disarm and failure to do so will trigger the trap.

When disabled the light disappears, a click sounds and the buzzing stops.

#### Secrete Door

In the hall there is a secret door that leads to the Acid Pit. This is a secret door short cut to get from the Main Hall to the Wizard’s Laboratory. If the players find the secret door read the following.

`You notice a loose pile of dirt on the floor at the edge of the wall. Pressing on the door gently makes it glide open.`

The secret door is marked on the fake map and while the map doesn’t show an accurate setup of the dungeon it does provide hints to how to address some of its dangers. If the players try to proceed through the door jump to Area 5.

### 3. The Study

`This is obviously the Wizard’s Study. A messy bookshelf, a desk with a mountain of scrolls and a bizarre map spot the room. As you look about the room you can hear a faint moaning sound coming from a stairwell in the far corner of the room. Listening more carefully the moans sound like a symphony of mindless souls down those stairs.`

Within the room, there is a bookshelf, a desk, a map and a spiral staircase leading below the dungeon.

**Bookshelf** The bookshelf is filled with books, scrolls and maps written in ancient languages. Some of the books are dusty but most of them look freshly shelved. On the floor you can see a book opened and marked to a specific page.

If the players examine the book…

`Inscribed inside the cover is “The Wizard of the Mountains, Dmitry”.`

Further examination leads to three book marks. The Red, Blue and Black bookmarks. Each book mark is to a specific section of the book. If the players go to the sections provide the following:

* Red: `The Red bookmark takes you to journal notes from a few months ago. They read: “My discussions with The Other have enlightened me that there are other worlds. These worlds extend beyond this Plane, beyond the Outer Planes and into realities that bend our natural order. From our last session I have finally been shown how to construct a device to tap into other realities, to tap into the powers that create magic in our world.” From there the notes turn to schematic drawings.` Hand players the schematics found [here](images/PortalSchematics.jpg).
* Blue: The Blue Bookmark is invisible to the naked eye and can only be seen with True Sight or by one of the characters with Awakened Psionics. If the characters do not have either of these abilities, they cannot read the page no matter what. If they do, read the following: `The Wizard’s notes are scrawled and barely legible from a nervous hand: “Device has been activated. Something came through. A Beast who can see into my mind. Now with my waking eyes I see it’s green eyes staring at me…hunting me. It is not using magic, some other power. The Other spoke nothing of this. I opened the door and it came through. Now I must retreat to the caverns below where it cannot follow. The Obsidian was used to open the door but apparently the Beast cannot touch the black obsidian stone. I will build artifacts to defeat it in the caverns and then reclaim my domain.”`
* Black: The Black Bookmark is just a scribbled ink line. The Wizard was trying to write but the scribble appears as if he forgot how to write as soon as his pen touched the page.

**Map of the Planes** On the wall hangs a bizarre map of other worldly places. You cannot decipher the text on the map but it clearly illustrates a world outside of this world along with points that seem to be gateways. 

**Desk** `On the desk you see some bottles, empty and full of potions complete or half-prepared. You also see some scrolls and open books but nothing interesting or in a language you can understand. One scroll shows a diagram of a cadaver, a beetle and the illustration of a glove. Weird.`

Further digging around the desk and a perception check (at least a Medium to represent sorting through the crazy pile of scrolls on the desk) leads to the characters finding a thick leather glove like that of a bee keeper but much thicker. This glove is used later in the dungeon to retrieve the Obsidian Scarab and should be documented for the player that has it. 

**Stairs Down** In the corner of the room is a spiral staircase going down into darkness. Shining the torch down the stairs the players can hear shuffling and moaning like many mindless zombies are down below. Waving the torch to see further doesn’t provide any sign of what is to come.
