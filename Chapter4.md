# Return to Madness

Emerging from the caverns, the players instantly feel the rush of the psionic assault over take them. Like in Chapter 2, use the exhaustion rules. Each player should take an Intelligence check against a Hard DC to see if the exhaustion effects the character. Any character involved in The Awakened adventure hook get a +2 bonus to their check as their psionic powers would naturally resist the psionic assault of another.

Beyond the psionic rush, the players find themselves in the wizard’s laboratory. Apparently, Dmitry was performing strange operations and explorations on living creatures.

## 4. The Laboratory

`A wave of exhaustion over takes you just like when you first entered the dungeon. As your senses balance out you see a strange laboratory surrounding you. This must be Dmitry’s laboratory. Shelves of skulls line one wall, while the center of the room has a medical table with a cadaver. Strangest yet, at the far end of the room you can see a tree rising from a pool of acid. The only normal thing in this room is a wooden door to your right.`

**Shelves of Skulls** Along the walls to the left are series of book shelfs with skulls of various shapes and sizes.

`Along the northern wall are long shelves of skulls. The skulls look like they belong to a variety of creatures from human to orc and other strange beasts.`

If the players search the shelves they will find 3gp with a Perception check. Other than that, they will also find a skull with strange markings.

**Corpse** In the center of the room is a medical examination table with a corpse on it. The stomach of the body is opened with its internal organs bulging. Read the following:

`An aged corpse lies on a make shift medical table. There is an incision down the center of the body stitched up except for a small opening near the stomach of the body. The stomach is bulging as if something is stuffed in there. Closer examination and you can hear the faint chirping of something inside the body.`

If the players examine the body they will see that their hand could fit into the body. If they listen, the chirping continues and puts them in mind of a large insect. Careful watching of the body and the characters will start to think they notice the bulge in the body moving around.

Characters can reach into the body, but this is where they need to use the glove. If they use the glove to reach in and get the Obsidian Scarab, then nothing happens. If they use their hand, then the scarab will bite the player and summons a defender from the acid pool (with the tree). Use the Merfolk stats for the creatures that crawl from the acid. Their number will be equal to the number of players in the party (NPCs don’t count if the Barbarians have survived this long). Read the following to start the encounter:

`As you reach into the body you are instantly bitten by something inside the body. Grabbing on to it you pull out the Obsidian Scarab that Dmitry described. The wriggling insect turns inanimate as you pull it from the body but from the acid pool you see human sized creatures crawl onto the dungeon floor. As they stand up you notice their half human – half fish features. Their thick greenish blue scales drip acid as they raise up their spears to attack.`

The **merfolk** are guarding the Obsidian Scarab and will concentrate their attack on the character who is in possession of the item.

**The Tree** is growing out of a pool of acid. While the tree appears dead and twisted from the acidic poison, fruit is growing from the tree. The fruit appears to be like apples but strange in color. If the players eat any of the fruit they will be poisoned for real not just psionically. The tree is very real. The tree is about 8 feet tall and looks very old, warped and dead.

Behind the tree is a platform matching the rest of the dungeon floor. Halfway up the wall there is a crank that looks like a large wheel valve. Players will need to cross the acid pool to get to the wheel valve. They can jump the 20 feet (if they can) or climb the tree to cross the acid. Other methods like flying or other magic means can also work.

When the players turn the wheel valve, the acid pit surrounding the tree drains. The players will also hear draining in the distance. If they encountered the acid hallway already, the players will recognize the draining came from the acid hallway.

**The Door** On the western wall the characters will find a wooden door. The door opens into a hallway. If the players have not turned the wheel valve by the tree the hall is filled with acid and impassable. If they did turn the wheel valve, the hall is empty and passable.

## 5. The Guardian’s Hallway

Depending on when the characters encounter this hallway determines how you should introduce it. If the players have not drained the hallway yet via the wheel valve found in the Laboratory (area 4) read the following:

`The stinging scent of acid pierces your nose. The hallway floor is covered in it with no ledges or foot holds to cross. The walls and ceiling are covered in what appears to be ropes that are slithering along the walls and ceiling just out of reach.`

If the players have drained the hallway read the following:

`The hallway stinks of acid that recently drained away. The floor and bottoms of the walls are burned from the acid. Along the walls you notice what appear to be ropes wriggling over the walls. The ropes lead down the hallway, too dark to see where.`

**Examining** If the players examine the ropes they appear to be like normal ropes but moving on their own. The ropes appear to be rooted into the walls like vines flowing into the stone walls. Touching the rope causes the rope to lash out at the player not causing any damage but pushing the player away. The ropes don't burn and cannot be pulled from the walls.

**Encounter** At the end of the hallway, standing in front of the iron door to the Sanctum is the Guardian. This horror from another dimension protects the Beast, the flood of psionic energy and the flow of magic feeding it’s realm of evil. Treat the Guardian as if it were a **Flesh Golem** for stats.

If you are using miniatures, consider using an other worldly humanoid creature. If you are not familiar with the Wyrd Games Malifaux series of miniatures, they could be an excellent source of inspiration. Figures like Archie or Arcane Emissary would be excellent as they fit concept of something other worldly and horrible.

`Standing in front of an iron door is what you assume to be the Guardian. It looks like nothing of this world. It watches you intently, preparing for attack if you come too close.`

The Guardian will attack the characters if they come within 20 feet of it. It is a mindless sentry looking to prevent anyone from passing through the door. If the players come within 20 ft, the Guardian will charge towards them. By using this distance and charge the characters can bait the Guardian to the Rope trap. If the players disabled the rope trap when they passed through, they can enable the trap with a DC15 on Dexterity.

### Secret Door

With a successful Perception check, players can find a secret door along the walls. If the door was found in earlier chapters, then the doorway would be open already.

`You feel a draft coming through the cracks in the wall. A gentle push and the walls pivot open to the Main Hall you encountered earlier.`

### Trap

In the Guardian’s Hall there is a single trap immediately after the secret door. This last trap was built to keep invaders out of the central Sanctum. This trap is not only for the players but is added here to provide a mechanism to easily ensnare and disable the Guardian.

#### T3: Dmitry’s Web of Strangulation

**Complex Trap:** Level 1 - 4, dangerous threat

**Purpose:** Slay

The ropes that line the walls and ceiling ensnare the character, tightening until the characters are strangled.

**Trigger:** Floor Pressure Plate

The floor plate is slightly raised and can be noticed with a Hard difficulty check (vs. Perception). Once stepped upon the plate depresses and the ropes lash out from the walls to ensnare and strangle the players.  The players cannot break free from the ropes no matter how strong they are nor, can they cut the ropes or disable them in any way with their weapons. The only escape from the ropes is to go limp. Once the characters stop resisting the ropes will drop them.

**Effects**
Ensnarement
Strangulation

**Disabling**
To disable the trap players, need to use the Thieves Kit at DC15, no kit takes DC20. An attempt to disarm and failure to do so will trigger the trap.

When disabled the ropes become still along the walls and ceiling.

## 6. Lair of the Beast

`As you enter the room, you can feel other worldly energies flowing around you. The room is grand in scale, with four large pillars raising up high and on the back wall, a massive crack where black viscous liquid is pouring as if a flood of evil is filling the room. At the center of the room a spiral of this black liquid reaches up and spins around a perfect Obsidian Orb. Prismatic magical energies flow into the orb in pulsating draws like inhaling deeply followed by the crack in the wall violently vomiting more of the thick black fluid.`

`Around the orb and swirling fluid, a Beast is prowling like a cat watching you and walking side to side. The Beast looks like a panther but where it's tail should be four tentacles flail about slowly like they are feeling the mystical energies around you. Its green eyes are those you have seen before in the darkness. Quickly the Beast climbs up one of the pillars and stares down at you from above.`

**Interactions** The Beast is a psionic **Displacer Beast** and can read the players thoughts. This means the Beast will know what the players are expressing their characters are thinking. Represent this within the game by the fact that the Beast always has initative for any actions relating to the players.

If the players talk to the Beast, the Beast can answer the following questions:

"Where do you come from?"
`A distant realm devoid of the mystical energies that so freely flow here.`

"What do you want?"
`Your magical and mental energies.`

"Why did you come here?"
`For your magical and mental energies. My world needs your magic. I'm here to feed my world and feed from your minds. Without magic we have found other energies to channel and manipulate the world.`

"What will happen to our world?"
`We only want your magical energies, but we will need all of it to re-ignite the Mage Forge and bring magic back. Unfortunately, that will leave your world like mine, barren and dying.`

Anything else results in quiet from the Beast and continual prowling.

**Hallucinations** increase as the characters are now in the point where the other worldly psionic energy is literally pouring into their world. Every three turns characters should save against hallucinations as described in Chapter 2. During the hallucinations the Beast recharges Psi Points.

**Encounter** the battle with the Beast is a battle of skills. The players can use the Beetle to drain the Beast's Psi Points. The players must get close to the Beast for this to work (distance of 10 feet). Each turn saps 2 Psi Points from the Beast. The Beast can recover a Psi point by concentrating for a round.

The Beast attacks using Celerity and Psionic Weaponry on its claws. After the Beast has spent half of its Psi Points it will retreat to the top of the pillars to regain Psi points through concentration. The top of the pillars will be out of the players reach.

Once the players strike the Beast with the beetle, the Psi points are drained, and any active discipline is immediately stopped. The Beast is unable to concentrate for 4 rounds and is just a normal Displacer Beast.

On defeating the Beast read the following:
`The Beast collapses to the floor gasping for final breath. The battle is over or, so you thought. Magical energy is still being pulled into the orb and the liquid still pours from the crack in the wall.`
