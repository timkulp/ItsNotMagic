## Encountering The Other
In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, magic is as natural as water. While sometimes not common, it is known and understood to exist. Characters in the worlds of D&D recognize that magic is a great power that flows through the multiverse as a power that can build or destroy worlds. Now imagine what it would be like to learn there is another power, a greater power that does not come from manipulating nature, it comes from within.

Welcome to *It’s Not Magic* an adventure that takes players in a world where magic is not the ultimate power. Deep into a Wizard’s Dungeon known as The Madhouse players will encounter other worldly horrors, deadly traps and awaken dormant powers within themselves.

This journey into darkness is best for 2-4 players levels 3-5. Ideal character classes for this are non-magical classes like Fighters, Monks, Rangers, Thieves, etc. Magic is not the best tool here but a steady sword or better yet, steady hands can save the day.

## Themes
*It’s Not Magic* is about encountering the unknown when greed for things or knowledge leads to our darkest places.

Throughout this adventure the players will be facing fear, other worldly horrors and powers unlike anything seen before. Take inspiration for this adventure from tales where humanity seeks forbidden knowledge such as the stories of H.P. Lovecraft or strange journeys like William Hope Hodgson. The experiences of the players are other worldly, strange and from these things, terrifying. 

### Sanity & Horror
In this adventure we will be exploring horrors of another world that pull apart the player's sanity. To represent this, implement the optional **Sanity** score. Each encounter with madness will eat away at this score until all that is left is a slobering, blob of player character.

All player characters start with 10 sanity. 

* **Ten (10)** represents a firm grip on the player character's known world. 
* **Six (6)** represents the player character is slipping. Halucinations can occur but the PC still knows what is real.
* **Three (3)** represents the PC can't distinguish between what is real and what isn't anymore.
* **Zero (0)** represents total madness where the PC is catatonic.

Take madness as a great opportunity to role play and reward PCs who explore their character's grip on reality.

## Mood
Setting the mood for the adventure is always critical for the best time. The player’s journey from tavern to dungeon to caverns to deeper dungeons is a journey into darkness both literally and figuratively. Match this journey with proper lighting and audio support. 

**Lighting** for this adventure is best when using LED Candles. Get the large candles that kick off a lot of light, not the tea lights. Start the Tavern with a room full of light. This is the brightest time for the players. As your party moves into the dungeon, bring the lights down or switch to only use the LED Candles (representing the player’s torches). In the Caverns reduce the number of candles to heighten the sense of darkness and isolation. Using lighting to adjust the mood can add a powerful element to your game.

**Audio** provides a heighten sense of drama throughout the game. Matching the lighting, audio can be used to take the players from jovial to forboding as they descend into the dungeon.

When working with music avoid soundtracks. If a soundtrack starts playing and the players’ mind goes to the movie associated with the soundtrack, the mood will be broken.

## Setting
So where is this adventure? Well that is up to you. The content here is kept fairly generic and can be modified to be where ever you’d like be it the Forgotten Realms, Equestria or Malifaux. Be creative and adapt to your world how you see fit. As an example, you could start in the Yawning Portal tavern in Forgotten Realms and take the players into an undiscovered mountain cavern deep in the Sword Mountains. Have fun with the setting and take the players from the familiar to the alien. That makes things more fun for everyone.

## Story Summary

Players start in a tavern where drunk barbarians are claiming they found the ancient dungeon. During this time players can learn the rumors of Dmitry and the strange happenings in the village. Once the players obtain the map to the dungeon they go off to find it in the mountains east of the tavern. While the map to the dungeon is accurate, the second map, the map of the dungeon is incorrect and a forgery. 

In the dungeon, players immediately feel the impact of the psionic assault trying to determine their danger to the Beast. Through numerous traps and encounters the Beast is testing the players and eventually trying to stop them from getting to the Beast’s lair. Throughout the dungeon players find the possessions of an old wizard who was trying to connect to a realm that housed a new, more potent, magic that comes from within instead of the natural order of the multiverse. 

The only relief from the psionic assault is when the players descend into the caverns below the dungeon. The cavern walls are lined with obsidian which naturally dampens psionic powers. Within the caverns players encounter Dmitry, the cursed wizard who created the rip in the multiverse to an unknown dimension where dark things slithered through the portal – wounding the wizard and taking over his dungeon. Dmitry tells the players of a tool he crafted from his studies of the Beast’s powers and how it was left above in the dungeon. 

Players return to the dungeon to hunt for the tool (an Obsidian Scraab). As the players press deeper into the dungeon they encounter the Beast’s Guardian, an animated puppet that appears more like a bloated rag doll than the muscle to a monster from another dimension.

Beyond the Guardian, the players encounter the Beast in the sanctuary of the dungeon complex. After battling the Beast, the players need to close the portal to the other dimension by shattering the stone in the center of the room that is holding the rift open. Once the stone is shattered, the portal collapses and any psionic powers the players had manifested end.
