# Adventure Hooks & History

Use the following history and adventure hooks to create a more engaging experience for your players. While you don't have to use all of this (or any of it), I do recommend using The Awakened hook as that will give your players access to psionic powers and make the game a bit more interesting.

## History

Once upon a time there was a wizard named Calvin. Like many wizards Calvin was keen on digging deeper into forbidden knowledge within the privacy of his dungeon keep. Hidden in the twisted caverns and valleys of the mountains, Calvin was known as a hermit by the locals wandering into the nearby village for supplies on rare occasions. On his last visit to the village, Calvin bought many years worth of provisions and claimed that he would not be returning. After that he disappeared all together from the village as the villagers spread word of his death or ascension into another realm. Rumors still spread of the wizard from the mountains and what happened to him.

A few months ago, the number of strangers passing through the village noticeably increased. Strange foreigners claiming a feeling pulled them here or dreams guided them to this place. Few are seen again but those who are claiming to have found the wizard’s dungeon and the vast riches within. All those who return, soon after returning all of them go mad claiming that they cannot escape those eyes in the darkness.

Calvin did not die, nor did he ascend. In his dungeon he sought help from dark places to find forbidden knowledge. He called into the darkness to command the unknown powers that crafted the mystical energies that now form the forces of Magic. From the darkness, something answered. Calvin thought it to be a demon lord or creature from the outer planes. His mortal imagination couldn’t fathom the horrors lurking beyond the known, beyond the limits of the planes and into a darkness more ancient than the multiverse. The answer came in the form of an obsidian orb infused with specific magical properties and attuned to the unperceivable vibrations of the multiverse.

Calvin built the obsidian orb from the caverns below his dungeon, crafted the spells to power it and then without thought activated the device. Immediately reality ripped apart a viscous darkness poured from a crack in the wall. From the darkness eyes emerged and a formless shadow lept into the world. Calvin was no match for the Beast’s power and he retreated to the caverns and his study to understand the Beast, where it came from and most importantly it’s power. Over time Calvin’s body was warped by the twisted reality he had unleashed leaving him a shadow of his former self.

## Adventure Hooks

### The Awakening

Pick one or two of you most experience players and give them a back story that a few months ago they started having nightmares like the following:

You can feel the presence of another in the room with you. Black tentacles whip around your feet as a cold wind blows past you repeatedly. In the darkness you can see two green eyes watching you as a monstrous, formless beast leaps from the shadows towards you.

To set the mood, you can print this onto an index card to hand out to your players who have the dream. The players with the dream have felt drawn to this place. Through dreams and a feeling like a magnetic pull to this area, the players have come here because they could do nothing else.

Players who have that dream start manifesting Psionic powers as a level one Mystic. Treat this as a dual class with their primary class being whatever they chose during character creation. Players don’t understand their psionic powers resulting in random manifestations of their power. We’ll examine this more in the Wild Talents section.

### Ancient Power and Treasure

Rumors swirl around this place of an ancient dungeon, hidden in the mountains and home to a powerful wizard who disappeared recently. Many adventures have gone looking for this place. Those who have returned tell tales of riches and wealth beyond imagine. They tell this story to anyone who will listen until they inevitably go insane.

The players have been searching for the dungeon for weeks now but to no luck. They are in the tavern searching for a guide who can take them to the dungeon.

### Mysterious Case of Missing Magic

Recently magic has been losing its potency around these parts. The players have come to investigate this bizarre occurrence. Rumor and a string of crazy adventurers has led the players to this tavern where they are looking to find their next clue on why magic is fading around the neighboring mountain range.

If one of the players is a magic user (Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock) they ability to use magic will be impacted the deeper they go into the Wizard’s dungeon. In this adventure hook the psionic energy pouring out from the other dimension is also sucking in magical energies. Left unchecked, the other dimension will drain this world of its magical energies rendering it a dead world.
